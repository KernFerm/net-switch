## 🛡️ Supported Versions

Security updates and patches are provided for the following versions of NetSwitch:

| Version | Supported          | Security Updates |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes             | ✅ Active        |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              | ❌ End of Life   |

**Note**: Only the latest stable release receives security updates. Users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest version.

## 🔐 Security Features

NetSwitch implements multiple layers of security protection:

### Input Sanitization & Validation

- **✅ String Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to remove control characters and malicious content
- **✅ IP Address Validation**: Comprehensive IPv4 and IPv6 address validation with strict format checking
- **✅ Network Adapter Validation**: Sanitization of network adapter names to prevent injection attacks
- **✅ Command Argument Sanitization**: All subprocess arguments are cleaned and validated
- **✅ Length Limits**: Input length restrictions to prevent buffer overflow attacks

### Command Injection Prevention

- **✅ Parameterized Commands**: All system commands use parameterized execution
- **✅ Whitelist Validation**: Only predefined, safe commands are executed
- **✅ Argument Escaping**: Special characters are properly escaped or removed
- **✅ Timeout Protection**: All system operations have timeout limits

### Application Security

- **✅ Safe Defaults**: Secure fallback values for all operations
- **✅ Error Handling**: Sanitized error messages that don't leak system information
- **✅ Thread Safety**: Background operations use daemon threads
- **✅ Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of system resources

### Data Protection

- **✅ No Credential Storage**: Application doesn't store passwords or sensitive credentials
- **✅ Minimal Privileges**: Requests only necessary system permissions
- **✅ Local Operation**: All operations are performed locally (no data transmission)
- **✅ Memory Safety**: Sensitive data is not retained in memory unnecessarily

## 🚨 Vulnerability Reporting

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability in NetSwitch, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability publicly until it has been resolved
3. **DO** report vulnerabilities through one of these secure channels:

#### Preferred Method: Email
- **Email**: [securitygithubissue@fnbubbles420.org](mailto:securitygithubissue@fnbubbles420.org)
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] NetSwitch Vulnerability Report`
- **PGP Key**: Available upon request for encrypted communications

#### Alternative Method: GitHub Security Advisory
- Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
- Navigate to the repository's Security tab
- Click "Report a vulnerability"

### Information to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

```
1. Description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Potential impact and severity
4. Affected versions
5. Any proof-of-concept code (if applicable)
6. Suggested fix or mitigation (if known)
7. Your contact information for follow-up
```

### What NOT to Include

- **❌** Do not include actual exploits that could cause harm
- **❌** Do not test vulnerabilities on systems you don't own
- **❌** Do not access or modify data that doesn't belong to you

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Installation Security
```bash
# Always verify Python installation
python --version  # Should be 3.11.9+

# Use virtual environments
python -m venv netswitch-env
netswitch-env\Scripts\activate

# Install from trusted sources only
pip install customtkinter>=5.2.2

# Verify file integrity (if checksums provided)
```

#### Runtime Security
- **🔑 Run as Administrator**: Required for DNS changes, but understand the implications
- **🔍 Monitor Changes**: Review DNS changes before applying
- **🚫 Avoid Custom Scripts**: Don't modify the application code without understanding
- **📱 Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version for security fixes

#### Network Security
- **🔥 Firewall**: Ensure Windows Firewall is enabled
- **🛡️ Antivirus**: Keep antivirus software updated
- **🌐 DNS Security**: Use reputable DNS providers (Cloudflare, Google, Quad9)
- **📊 Monitor Traffic**: Be aware of network changes after DNS modifications

### For Developers

#### Code Security
```python
# Always sanitize inputs
user_input = sanitize_string(user_input, max_length=100)

# Validate before processing
if not is_valid_ip(dns_address):
    return False

# Use timeouts for operations
subprocess.run(cmd, timeout=30)

# Handle errors securely
except Exception as e:
    error_msg = sanitize_string(str(e), 200)
    log_error(html.escape(error_msg))
```

#### Development Environment
- **🔐 Secure Development**: Use secure coding practices
- **🧪 Security Testing**: Test with malicious inputs
- **📝 Code Review**: Review all security-related changes
- **🔍 Dependency Scanning**: Monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities

## ⚠️ Known Security Considerations

### Administrator Privileges

**Risk**: NetSwitch requires administrator privileges to modify DNS settings.

**Mitigation**:
- Application requests minimal necessary permissions
- All operations are logged and transparent
- Users are informed about privilege requirements
- No unnecessary system access is performed

### System Command Execution

**Risk**: Application executes system commands (netsh, ipconfig, ping).

**Mitigation**:
- Commands are hardcoded and parameterized
- All arguments are sanitized and validated
- Timeout limits prevent hanging operations
- Only safe, predefined commands are executed

### Network Configuration Changes

**Risk**: Modifying DNS settings affects network connectivity.

**Mitigation**:
- Changes are reversible
- Safe fallback DNS servers are available
- User confirmation required for changes
- Clear status feedback provided

### Dependency Vulnerabilities

**Risk**: Third-party dependencies may contain vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation**:
- Minimal dependency footprint
- Regular dependency updates
- Vulnerability monitoring
- Trusted sources only (PyPI)
